## üß† Intelligent Bitcoin Puzzle Solver
***A sophisticated, self-evolving cryptographic puzzle solver that uses adaptive intelligence to search for Bitcoin private keys in the 2^70 to 2^71 range.***

## üß† Adaptive Intelligence
- `Self-learning algorithm`: that evolves its strategy based on partial successes

- `Real-time pattern recognition`: from hash prefix matches

- `Dynamic resource allocation`: between exploration and exploitation

## üîç Multiple Search Strategies
- `Exploration Mode:` Broad random search to discover new promising areas

- `Exploitation Mode:` Focused search around keys with high partial matches

- `Pattern Analysis:` Mathematical sequence testing (powers of 2, Fibonacci, primes)

- `Neighborhood Exploration:` Deep investigation of promising regions

## ‚ö° Performance Optimized
- *12-thread parallel processing* for maximum throughput

- *OpenSSL-accelerated cryptography* for fast hashing

- *Thread-local crypto contexts* to minimize initialization overhead

- *Smart memory management with BIGNUM* for large number handling

## üöÄ How It Works
**The Intelligence System**
The solver tracks every partial match (when a hash starts with the same characters as the target) and builds an intelligence map:
```cpp
struct SearchIntelligence {
    std::map<int, uint64_t> prefix_matches;     // Track match lengths
    std::map<std::string, int> promising_ranges; // Promising key areas
    int adaptive_threshold = 8;                 // Auto-adjusting focus threshold
    double focus_intensity = 0.3;               // Dynamic resource allocation
};
```
**Adaptive Worker Behavior**
*Each thread can switch between strategies:*

1. ***When it finds good partial matches*** ‚Üí Focuses search around those areas

2. ***When progress stalls*** ‚Üí Expands search to new regions

3. ***When patterns emerge*** ‚Üí Tests mathematical sequences

***Real-time Evolution***

- ***Raises match threshold*** when better partial matches are found

- ***Increases focus intensity*** as evidence accumulates

- ***Learns which strategies work*** and allocates resources accordingly
